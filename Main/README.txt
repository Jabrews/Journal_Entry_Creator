This is a program that allows you to create and search for journal entries directly in your files. You can search for them by: date ranges, tags, and title.

NOTE:
This is the biggest project I've yet created so it was a little hard to manage. All the features are there and all crash accounted for but the .py file and class managment is little sloppy. I'll make sure in my coming projects to clean that up a little.
